                <li><b>Session Cookies:</b> Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from page to page within the Sites and Services and are typically deleted once you close your browser.</li>
                <li><b>Persistent Cookies:</b> Persistent cookies reside on your system and allow us to customize your experience if you leave and later return to the Sites and Services. For example, persistent cookies may allow us to remember your preferences and provide you with personalized content.</li>

            <p>We work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you our ads or other of our content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may also show you third-party ads or content when you engage with our Sites. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Sites or Services as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information, including across time, devices, and websites. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Advertiser may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Sites, on third-party websites, or on social media properties. Using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiated, you can opt out of several Advertisers’ activities. For more information, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page. Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out preferences for each device and browser. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising and not all advertising networks participate. You may still receive other types of online advertising.</p>

Accordingly, we employ commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect such Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and use, both in transit and at rest. Even with these safeguards, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our Sites or Services, you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <h4>Other Websites</h4>
            <p>Please be aware that third-party websites accessible through the Sites or recommended through our Services may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.

            <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands, and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law.</p>
